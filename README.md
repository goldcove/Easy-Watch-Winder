# watchwinder
*Yet another Arduino based watch winder*

## Requirements

### Software

### Hardware
- Step motor â€“ Welleman vma401 with ULN2003 driver board (https://www.velleman.eu/downloads/29/vma401_a4v01.pdf)
- 5mm motor shaft coupler with flange coupling

## Operation

## Development milestones
### Version 1.0
- Basic software and hardware to safely wind a watch.
### Version 2.0
- Advanced operation
  - TPD selector
  - Turn direction selector
  - Power switch

## Background info
### Watch-specific factors (variables) affecting the programming:
- Turns per day (TPD)
  - Typically between 500-950, ref. [Orbita.com](https://www.orbita.com/winder-support)
- Rest (time)
  - Function of TPD and a predefined runtime variable.
- Runtime
   - Find best practice for runtime interval.
- Direction of turning
  - Clockwise (CW)
  - Counter clockwise (CCW)
  - Both
- Smooth motor operation

Example watch movement specification:

| Movement | TPD | Turn direction |
| ---      | --- | ---            |
| Sellita SW200 | 650-800 | Both |

### Factors (Watch-specific) affecting the hardware/construction:
- Three-way switch for selecting rotation
- Two-way on-off switch
- Rheostat for adjusting TPD
- Noise (operation)
- Angle of watch housing (?)
- De-Magnetization
