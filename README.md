# Easy Watch Winder
*Yet another Arduino based watch winder*

Easy winder is an user friendly, low cost and watch-safe automatic watch winder.

Simply set the turns per day (TPD) and rotation variable in accordance with your wathc specification (See [Orbita.com](https://www.orbita.com/winder-support)) and run the program :-D

## Software requirements
Stepper.h built-in Arduino library (Note: Risk of motor overheat. See code for comment and fix)

## Hardware requirements
- Step motor â€“ E.g. Welleman vma401 (28BYJ-48)) with ULN2003 driver board (https://www.velleman.eu/downloads/29/vma401_a4v01.pdf)
- 5mm motor shaft coupler with flange coupling
- Arduino board
- Wires
- USB cable and power adapter (for power)
- Some sort of housing, e.g. a small box.

## Development milestones
### Version 1.0
- Basic software and hardware to safely wind a watch.

### Version 2.0
- Advanced operation
  - TPD selector
  - Turn direction selector
  - Power switch

## Background info
### Watch-specific factors (variables) affecting the programming:
- Turns per day (TPD)
  - Typically between 500-950, ref. [Orbita.com](https://www.orbita.com/winder-support)
- Rest (time)
  - Function of TPD and a predefined runtime variable.
- RPM. What is the normal RPM for watch winders?
- Runtime
   - Find best practice for runtime interval.
- Direction of turning
  - Clockwise (CW)
  - Counter clockwise (CCW)
  - Both
- Smooth motor operation

Example watch movement specification:

| Movement | TPD | Turn direction |
| ---      | --- | ---            |
| Sellita SW200 | 650-800 | Both |

### Factors (Watch-specific) affecting the hardware/construction:
- Three-way switch for selecting rotation
- Two-way on-off switch
- Rheostat for adjusting TPD
- Angle of watch housing?
    - Commercial watch winders use both vertical, horizontal and slanted mounting. Probably does not affect performance.
- De-Magnetization?
  - One source mentions this, probably safe to disregard.
